Hello and welcome to my Github Repo, "UdonSim"!
If you came across it, these are the public scripts for VRC that I have made to make
events that involve combat or simulation a little more immersive or just add
some easement in development process. I will update this Readme as more scripts
are added to explain each but if you have any questions feel free to reach out
to me on discord. Lusif#4807.

Some Unity and Udon knowledge is required.

- RepairToolTrigger
A simple addon that you attach to your vehicle(s)
to allow repair tools. You can create a tool by
spawning a particle that collides with UiMenu. (12)
